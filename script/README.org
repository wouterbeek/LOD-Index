#+TITLE: LOD-Index scripts
#+AUTHOR: Wouter Beek

This directory contains scripts for updating and using the online LOD
Index.

* Upload the index.
Script ~upload-index.sh~ collects the data description files from
~/data~ and uploads them to
https://data.lodlaundromat.org/wouter/index.

* Populate the seedlist.
Script ~upload-seeds.sh~ queries for document URLs from
https://data.lodlaundromat.org/wouter/index, and adds them to the
LOD-Seedlist service.

* Upload the dataset
Script ~upload-datasets.sh~ queries for datasets from
https://data.lodlaundromat.org/wouter/index and checks whether their
corresponding documents have already been cleaned by the
LOD-Laundromat.  If so, the dataset is uploaded to
https://data.lodlaundromat.org.
